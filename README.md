# Social_Club_Loaner

# What is the purpose of this project:
This is a DJANGO site with the focus in Social Club asset management. In social clubs, you will often have equipment and assets such as books, board games etc, that can be lend out to its members.

I have noticed in the social clubs that I join, these assets were often kept track using a notebook, or even worse, it isn't being recorded at all.

This website aims to provide the function in keeping track of a social club's assets in a simple interface.

I have created a site that if you are not logged in as a superuser, you will not be able to see the management tools and all you can see is just an information website of the club itself. 

Once you logged in, you will have the management tools shown in the navbar that allows you to manage your social club's assets.

Please note: You will have to create a superuser account in order to access these management tools.

I have also included a script named fit_me.py to allow you to import random test data into your DJANGO models to test out the site. The test data resembles that of a chess club.
